## Installation
- Run pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run python setup.py install
- Note that the code requires an older version of hugging face transformers.

## Datasets
- The CQ datasets along with the filters for filtered setting can be found in ./scripts/data/

## Hardware Requirements
- Linux with at least 2 GPUs each with 11GB or 1 GPU > 20G B, set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES appropriately.

## Running BiQE
1. run train.sh for training a model
2. run test.sh for evaluation


## Hyperparameters and Dataset details
- Set hyperparameters and dataset directories in train.sh and test.sh
- For wn18rr simply change the directory name from fb15k-237 to wn18rr in train.sh/test.sh
